        "reason": "The Pro side presented a more compelling and urgent case for the regulation of artificial intelligence. Their arguments around mitigating existential risks and addressing bias were strong and effectively conveyed the high stakes involved. The Pro side successfully refuted the Con's central argument that regulation stifles innovation, by providing historical examples of regulation driving technological advancements and building public trust. While the Con side raised valid points about the potential for premature regulation to hinder innovation and the difficulty in defining AI, the Pro side offered practical and adaptable counter-solutions, such as tiered regulation and focusing on specific high-risk capabilities, which demonstrated that the challenges are surmountable. The Pro side's proactive stance, coupled with well-reasoned rebuttals to the Con's concerns about existing legal frameworks' inadequacy for novel AI issues, ultimately made their argument for regulation more convincing and robust. The Con's reliance on 'wait and see' and 'adapting existing laws' felt less equipped to handle the rapidly evolving and potentially transformative nature of AI compared to Pro's call for proactive, thoughtful regulation."
